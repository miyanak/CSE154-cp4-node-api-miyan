          <strong>How to Play:</strong>
          The two players are each delt 26 cards face-down from the
          standard 52 card deck. Each player turns the card on the top of their deck face-up at the
          same time. The player with the higher card wins, takes both cards, and places them in a
          separate stack. However, if the cards are the same rank, War occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Going to War:</strong>
          To go to war, each player places three cards from the top of their deck face-down on top
          of the cards they went to war on. Both players then flip their fourth card face-up on
          their stacks. Whoever has the higher fourth card wins and takes all the cards used in the
          war. If the fourth cards are the same value, another war occurs in the same fashion.
          If a player doesn't have enough cards for war, they must turn their last card face-up,
          this will be the card used to play war.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to Win:</strong>
          The winner is the player who wins all the cards in the deck.
